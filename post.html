		   What is happiness? Are you happy? Am I happy? If yes,  how do we know that we are happy.Well first of all there is no definition for happiness per se. It is truly a subjective matter.It is a feeling which all of us experience from time to time.Is happiness culture specific or is it a universal concept.Well it’s a matter of debate but experts say that it is both.The individualistic and collectivistic conceptions of self provide different basis for the meaning of happiness.Happiness in America can be individual’s subjective judgment about his own life whereas in India happiness of an individual can be related to the happiness of his family and relationships.

Happiness is broadly classified into two types: Hedonic and Eudaimonic

Hedonic happiness is expressed in terms of subjective well being.It is seen as enjoyment of life and its worldly pleasures, life satisfaction. Hedonic activities make people relaxed, excited, content and happy and that leads to loosing track of time and personal problems.

happinessHedonism is not new to us. A form of hedonistic life sytle has been part of our philosophy since ages. One of the earliest  to talk about hedonism was Carvaka philosophy. It dealt with the materialistic view of life.Carvaka rejected the idea of spiritualism and professed that the ultimate aim of humans is to enjoy pleasure.The following couplet from Carvaka gives a fair idea on the type of living it suggested.

Yavatjivet Sukham Jivet Wrinam Kritwa Ghritam Pibet
Bhasmabhutasya Dehasya Punaragamanam Kutah

“As long as you live, live happily and merrily, eat ghee even if you have to borrow. Because once the body is turned to ashes there is no coming back and no repayment of  loans”
Eat, drink and be happy kind of thought you see. I guess most of us are following the same philosophy.
Second type of happiness is eudaimonic i.e happiness which is in accordance with our diamon(true self).It is expression and fulfillment of our inner potential.
Sometimes despite having all the materialistic pleasures of life we feel lost, we feel something is missing, something which can define my self, we seem to be happy but we are not happy. This means we are in search of happiness which is beyond the worldly pleasures.We are in quest of meaning of our life, we are in quest of defining our life.That is what is known as eudaimonic happiness – the happiness which results from striving towards self actualization.We are happiest when we achieve our goals and develop our inner potentials.
Self actualization is often talked about by the Humanistic psychologists and most famous one is Maslow’s Hierachy Of Needs theory. Maslow talks about basic needs which motivates a person to work and achieve those needs.On top of the hierarchy is the self actualization i.e after achieving the basic needs of food,sex,shelter,security,family and society one looks for self actualization and it is ultimate aim of life.
Well I guess we all are happy as well as unhappy in our own ways.We live a life which is both hedonistic as well as eudaimonistic sometimes if not always. Lucky are those who can live a hedonistic life always because eudaimonic happiness can be a heck of a challenge and perhaps not everyone can achieve it.
Before I windup, listed below are some factors which promote happiness :
Self acceptance – positive evaluation of self and one’s past
Positive relations with others
Strong sense of meaning and purpose in life
Autonomy – sense of self while taking actions and choices
Accurate perception of reality
Please note the list is not exhaustive and only includes some of the basic factors , do not forget that happiness is always subjective.
